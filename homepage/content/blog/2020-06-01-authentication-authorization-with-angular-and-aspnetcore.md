In this blog post I want to describe how you can add authentication and authorization in your Angular app using NgRx. we are using an ASP.NET Core backend to get our secret data from and a custom STS which we ask for the authentication and the id token as well as an access token.

This is a follow up post of [Authentication and Authorization with Angular and ASP.NET Core using OIDC and OAuth2](https://offering.solutions/blog/articles/2020/05/18/authentication-and-authorization-with-angular-and-asp.net-core-using-oidc-and-oauth2/) so if you want to get into the complete setup you might give this blog post a shot first :-)
